          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am currently a sophomore in my BS program at Boise State University. I have interests in art, animation, level design, character design. I also like the legend of zelda, indie games, hunter x hunter, ttrpgs, and cats!</p>
          <p>My creative journey started very early, when I was younger I loved making fake presentations and collages with my grandma. After becoming more familar with computers, I expanded to music videos and graphics of my online game characters. My love for video editing skyrocketed and I've been using Adobe After Effects for almost 6 years now, completely self-taught. I enjoy programming and game design because of my early interests, I think I was always meant to be a creative person.</p>
